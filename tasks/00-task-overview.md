## Dependencies and Blockers

### External Dependencies
- Google Cloud Console project setup (TASK-005)
- OAuth credentials configuration
- Domain/hosting for production deployment

### Internal Dependencies
- Each phase builds on the previous phase
- Core models required before sync implementation
- Sync engine required before web interface
- Testing depends on feature completion

### Risk Mitigation
- Start Google Cloud setup early (parallel to Django setup)
- Implement comprehensive error handling from the beginning
- Use mocked API responses for development and testing
- Plan for API rate limit handling
