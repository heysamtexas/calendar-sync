# Incremental Sync Optimization - Overview and Risk Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Calendar Sync Tool currently uses **naive full-sync polling** that creates and deletes identical busy blocks every 15 minutes, resulting in ~26,000 Google Calendar API calls per day. This document outlines implementing **incremental sync** using Google Calendar sync tokens to reduce API usage by 90%+ while maintaining reliability.

## Current State Analysis

### Polling-Based Architecture Problems
- **136 busy blocks created + 136 deleted = 272 API calls per sync**
- **96 syncs per day (every 15 minutes) = 26,112 API calls/day**
- **Pure waste:** Recreating identical busy blocks continuously
- **API limit risk:** Already at 3% of daily quota with single user
- **Scalability crisis:** 10 users would consume 26% of daily quota

### Existing Infrastructure (Ready for Incremental)
- âœ… `last_sync_token` field exists in Calendar model (unused)
- âœ… GoogleCalendarClient has event CRUD operations
- âœ… Cross-calendar busy block system established
- âœ… Error handling and logging framework in place

## Incremental Sync Benefits

### API Usage Reduction
- **Current:** 26,112 calls/day (272 per sync Ã— 96 syncs)
- **Projected:** 1,920 calls/day (20 per sync Ã— 96 syncs)
- **Reduction:** 92% fewer API calls
- **Scalability:** Can support 50+ users within same quota

### Performance Improvements
- **Faster syncs:** Only process actual changes
- **Reduced load:** Less database operations
- **Better UX:** Near real-time updates instead of batch processing
- **Lower costs:** Reduced server resources and API quota usage

## Critical Edge Cases and Risks

### ðŸš¨ **Risk Category 1: Cross-Calendar Dependencies**

**Problem:** Calendar A changes â†’ Must update busy blocks in Calendars B, C, D
**Current Solution:** Full cleanup/recreation ensures consistency
**Incremental Challenge:** How to propagate changes across calendar boundaries?

**Specific Scenarios:**
1. **Event deleted in Calendar A** â†’ Busy blocks in B, C, D become orphaned
2. **Event time changed in Calendar A** â†’ Busy blocks in B, C, D show wrong times
3. **New event in Calendar A** â†’ No busy blocks created in B, C, D

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Track source-target relationships in busy block metadata
- Implement change propagation system
- Add periodic orphan cleanup as safety net

### ðŸš¨ **Risk Category 2: Sync Token Fragility**

**Google Calendar Sync Token Limitations:**
- **Expire after ~7 days** of inactivity
- **Invalidated by "too many changes"** (undefined threshold)
- **Network issues** can corrupt token state
- **Account changes** can reset token validity

**Failure Scenarios:**
1. Token expires â†’ API returns 410 Gone â†’ Must do full sync
2. Invalid token â†’ API returns 400 Bad Request â†’ Must reset and full sync
3. Rate limiting during incremental â†’ Partial sync state corruption

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Graceful fallback to full sync on token errors
- Implement token refresh/validation logic
- Add sync state validation and recovery

### ðŸš¨ **Risk Category 3: Event Deletion Complexity**

**Google Calendar Deletion Behavior:**
- Deleted events return as `status: "cancelled"` in incremental sync
- Need to find ALL corresponding busy blocks across ALL calendars
- Current tag system has 200-character truncation issues

**Complex Scenarios:**
1. **Recurring event series deleted** â†’ Multiple busy blocks across multiple calendars
2. **Event exception deleted** â†’ Partial series cleanup needed
3. **Tag truncation** â†’ Cannot find all related busy blocks

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Enhance busy block tagging system for better tracking
- Implement robust cleanup queries
- Add validation for incomplete cleanup operations

### ðŸš¨ **Risk Category 4: Race Conditions and Concurrency**

**Current Architecture Assumptions:**
- Sequential calendar processing
- No concurrent modifications during sync
- Single-threaded busy block creation

**Incremental Sync Challenges:**
1. **Multiple calendars sync independently** â†’ Timing dependencies broken
2. **User makes changes during sync** â†’ Incremental state corruption
3. **Multiple sync processes** â†’ Database consistency issues

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement proper database transactions
- Add sync state locking mechanisms
- Design atomic operations for critical paths

### ðŸš¨ **Risk Category 5: Data Integrity and Consistency**

**Current Safety Mechanisms:**
- Full cleanup ensures no orphaned data
- Complete recreation guarantees consistency
- Time-bounded sync windows (30 days past, 90 days future)

**Incremental Risks:**
1. **Partial sync failures** â†’ Inconsistent state across calendars
2. **Database corruption** â†’ Sync tokens out of sync with reality
3. **Time window violations** â†’ Processing irrelevant old changes

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Add comprehensive data validation
- Implement consistency check procedures
- Design rollback mechanisms for failed syncs

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 (Foundation)
- âœ… Sync token storage and rotation working
- âœ… Graceful fallback to full sync on errors
- âœ… API call reduction >80% in normal operation

### Phase 2 (Reliability)
- âœ… Cross-calendar change propagation working
- âœ… Zero orphaned busy blocks after 24 hours
- âœ… Handles all deletion scenarios correctly

### Phase 3 (Production Ready)
- âœ… Multi-user operation without race conditions
- âœ… Recovery from all identified failure scenarios
- âœ… Performance monitoring and alerting

## Implementation Approach

### Phased Rollout Strategy
1. **Development implementation** with extensive testing
2. **Single-user deployment** with monitoring
3. **Gradual expansion** to multiple users
4. **Full production deployment** with fallback capability

### Rollback Plan
- Feature flag to disable incremental sync
- Immediate fallback to current full-sync polling
- Data integrity validation tools
- Emergency full-sync trigger capability
