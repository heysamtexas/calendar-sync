## 🎯 Quick Start

### Understanding the Problem
The current system suffers from webhook cascades because:
1. **Fragile Detection**: Relies on emoji prefixes and text parsing
2. **User Editable**: Text markers can be accidentally modified
3. **Race Conditions**: Webhooks arrive before tagging is complete
4. **Detection Failures**: Our own busy blocks are processed as user events

### The Solution
UUID correlation architecture provides:
1. **Bulletproof Tracking**: UUIDs embedded in invisible ExtendedProperties
2. **Perfect Detection**: Database-first approach with exact UUID matching
3. **Cascade Prevention**: Never process events we created
4. **Future-Proof**: Extensible metadata system for additional features

### Implementation Order
1. **Infrastructure**: Deploy EventState model and database schema
2. **Integration**: Add ExtendedProperties support to Google Calendar client
3. **Migration**: Add correlation IDs to existing Google Calendar events
4. **Engine**: Deploy new UUID-based sync engine with feature flag
5. **Rollout**: Gradual migration with monitoring and rollback capability

## 🔧 Key Components

### EventState Model
Tracks event correlation IDs and lifecycle states:
```python
class EventState(models.Model):
    correlation_id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True)
    calendar = models.ForeignKey(Calendar)
    google_event_id = models.CharField()
    event_type = models.CharField(choices=['user_event', 'busy_block'])
    created_by_us = models.BooleanField()
    source_correlation_id = models.UUIDField(null=True)
    status = models.CharField(choices=['creating', 'created', 'synced'])
```

### ExtendedProperties Integration
Invisible tracking in Google Calendar:
```python
extended_properties = {
    'private': {
        'calsync_id': correlation_id,
        'calsync_type': 'busy_block', 
        'calsync_source': source_correlation_id
    }
}
```

### Perfect Event Detection
UUID-based ownership detection:
```python
def is_our_event(google_event):
    correlation_id = extract_correlation_id(google_event)
    if correlation_id:
        return EventState.objects.filter(
            correlation_id=correlation_id,
            created_by_us=True
        ).exists()
    return False
```

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### Before Implementation
- Webhook cascades every few minutes
- Message numbers jumping by thousands  
- Events "blinking on/off" every 5 minutes
- Unreliable sync state

### After Implementation  
- **Zero webhook cascades**
- Stable message number progression
- Consistent event state across calendars
- Bulletproof sync operations

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] 100% correlation ID coverage for all events
- [ ] Zero webhook cascade incidents for 7+ days
- [ ] Sync success rate >99.5%
- [ ] Perfect event ownership detection accuracy

### Operational Requirements
- [ ] Zero-downtime migration capability
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and validated
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Team training on new architecture

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Webhook processing <3 seconds average
- [ ] Database queries optimized with indexes
- [ ] No memory leaks or resource consumption issues
- [ ] Graceful handling of Google API failures

## 🔒 Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Google API Rate Limits**: Batch operations with exponential backoff
2. **Database Performance**: Strategic indexes and connection pooling
3. **Data Consistency**: Validation commands and automated cleanup

### Low-Risk Areas
1. **User Experience**: Cosmetic changes only (no emojis in titles)
2. **Webhook Processing**: Minimal performance impact from UUID lookups
3. **Legacy Compatibility**: Fallback detection during transition

## 📈 Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
- Webhook cascade incidents (target: 0)
- Sync success rate (target: >99.5%)
- Event correlation ID coverage (target: 100%)
- Webhook processing time (target: <3s)
- Events stuck in 'creating' status (target: 0)

### Alert Conditions
- Any webhook cascade incident → Immediate alert
- Sync failure rate >5% → Warning alert  
- Events stuck creating >5 for >10min → Investigation alert
- Correlation ID coverage <95% → Data integrity alert
